+STMicroelectonics Multi-Function eXpander (STMFX) Core bindings
+
+ST Multi-Function eXpander (STMFX) is a slave controller using I2C for
+communication with the main MCU. Its main features are GPIO expansion, main
+MCU IDD measurement (IDD is the amount of current that flows through VDD) and
+resistive touchscreen controller.
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible: should be "st,stmfx-0300".
+- reg: I2C slave address of the device.
+- interrupts: interrupt specifier triggered by MFX_IRQ_OUT signal.
+  Please refer to ../interrupt-controller/interrupt.txt
+
+Optional properties:
+- drive-open-drain: configure MFX_IRQ_OUT as open drain.
+- vdd-supply: phandle of the regulator supplying STMFX.
+
+Example:
+
+	stmfx: stmfx@42 {
+		compatible = "st,stmfx-0300";
+		reg = <0x42>;
+		interrupts = <8 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
+		interrupt-parent = <&gpioi>;
+		vdd-supply = <&v3v3>;
+	};
+
+Please refer to ../pinctrl/pinctrl-stmfx.txt for STMFX GPIO expander function bindings.

+- #gpio-cells: should be <2>, the first cell is the GPIO number and the second
+  cell is the gpio flags in accordance with <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h>.

+  <dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h>.
+- interrupt-controller: marks the device as an interrupt controller.
+- gpio-ranges: specifies the mapping between gpio controller and pin
+  controller pins. Check "Concerning gpio-ranges property" below.
+Please refer to ../gpio/gpio.txt.
+
+Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt for pin configuration.
+
+Required properties for pin configuration sub-nodes:
+- pins: list of pins to which the configuration applies.
+
+Optional properties for pin configuration sub-nodes (pinconf-generic ones):
+- bias-disable: disable any bias on the pin.
+- bias-pull-up: the pin will be pulled up.
+- bias-pull-pin-default: use the pin-default pull state.
+- bias-pull-down: the pin will be pulled down.
+- drive-open-drain: the pin will be driven with open drain.
+- drive-push-pull: the pin will be driven actively high and low.
+- output-high: the pin will be configured as an output driving high level.
+- output-low: the pin will be configured as an output driving low level.
+
+Note that STMFX pins[15:0] are called "gpio[15:0]", and STMFX pins[23:16] are

+
+Concerning gpio-ranges property:
+- if all STMFX pins[24:0] are available (no other STMFX function in use), you

+- if agpio[3:0] are not available (STMFX Touchscreen function in use), you

+- if agpio[7:4] are not available (STMFX IDD function in use), you
+  should use gpio-ranges = <&stmfx_pinctrl 0 0 20>;

+Remoteproc System Resource Manager
+----------------------------------
+
+The remoteproc SRM (System Resource Manager) handles resources allocated
+to remote processors.
+This makes it possible for remote proc to reserve and initialize system
+resources for a peripheral assigned to a coprocessor.
+
+The devices are grouped in a core node
+
+Core
+====
+Required properties:
+- compatible: should be "rproc-srm-core"
+
+Dev
+===
+Required properties:
+- compatible: should be "rproc-srm-dev"
+
+Optional properties:
+- reg: register base address and length
+- clocks: clocks required by the coprocessor
+- clock-names: see clock-bindings.txt
+- pinctrl-x: pins configurations required by the coprocessor
+	The SRM reserves the pins for the coprocessor, which prevents the local
+	processor to use them.
+- pinctrl-names: all names must be prefixed with "rproc_" (ex: "rproc_default").
+	This rule must be strictly followed in order to prevent the SRM to
+	(over)write a pin configuration which is done by the coprocessor.
+- x-supply: power supplies required by the coprocessor
+- interrupts: external interrupts configurations required by the coprocessor.
+	This is optional since the configuration is done by the coprocessor.
+	When defined, the SRM (over)writes the configuration which allows the
+	interrupt controller to check for configuration conflicts.
+- interrupt-parent: see interrupts.txt
+- interrupt-names: see interrupts.txt
+
+Example:
+	system_resources {
+		compatible = "rproc-srm-core";

+
+Optional properties:
+ - vdd-supply: main power supply [4.1V;22V].
+ - vsys-supply: low power supply [3.0V;5.5V].
+ - vconn-supply: power supply [2.7;5.5V] used to supply VConn on CC pin in

+ - interrupts: interrupt specifier triggered by ALERT# signal.
+   Please refer to ../interrupt-controller/interrupt.txt
+ - pinctrl state named "default" may be defined to configure pin for #ALERT
+   signal
+
+USB-C connector attached to STUSB Type-C port controller can be described in
